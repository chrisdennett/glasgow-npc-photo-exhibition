      intro: `
      <p>Emma is a recent sustainable development graduate living in the Southside of Glasgow with her two preschoolers. </p>
       
      <p>An amateur photographer primarily capturing and sharing the biodiversity that her local parks and woodlands possess. From the start of the initial lockdown, her family set out and continues to work towards their John Muir Award for conservation. This includes identifying species throughout Castlemilk park. </p>
       
      <p>When not volunteering, King's park is a favourite haunt for the family. Here is where the children have space to run, climb, play and picnic. Her photos aim to highlight the importance Glasgow's parks have on the wellbeing of local families and biodiversity.</p>
       
      <p>She chose these specific photos to highlight how green, healthy and wild Glasgow really is. They are all taken within Castlemilk and King's park, yet she stresses, the vast majority of Glasgow's green space holds similar qualities and should be nationally celebrated.</p>`,

      Rider Glasgow's fantastic twitter profile provides "The (unofficial) view from a Glasgow Deliveroo rider's saddle" and it's this unique perspective which make his photos such a great snapshot of Glasgow.

      Everything from Friday night streets, to parks and green spaces and the hidden garden's and closes dropping off takeaways the photos really bring the beauty and the personality of Glasgow to life. </p>`,

      intro: `
      <p>I started my Twitter feed as Walk to Work Glasgow in April 2019. 
      </p>
      <p>
      I’m fortunate to be able to walk to work mostly along the River Kelvin and through the Botanic Gardens. It was spring and I was gradually starting to take more notice of the season changing around me as I walked, and often
      stopping to take photos with my phone. I was using Twitter at work at the time, so I decided to start
      my own feed as a daily journal of the walk. 
      </p>
      <p>
      The first images were the obvious stuff - sun on the river, tree shadows, pink rhododendrons bursting out - but I wanted to see a bit more detail. I
      bought a couple of clip-on macro lenses for the phone and then my focus expanded to tiny water droplets on feathers and petals, insects, ice and frost structures, spiders’ webs. I’m fascinated by combinations of colours, shapes and textures and the infinitely varied effects of light.
      </p>
      <p>
      Rather ironically, I’ve been working from home since last March rather than walking to work, but
      I’ve kept up my daily walks in the park. The fact that Glasgow still has a good network of public
      parks and open spaces will have been a great help to many during the course of the pandemic - it
      has been much busier along the Kelvin at times in recent months. 
      </p>
      <p>
      This period of lockdown has
      emphasised how important it is for people in such a large city to have access to safe places to
      exercise, to slow down and stop, to just breathe. You can choose to be solitary in a park, or be in
      company - I’ve met a few people from my Twitter feed while taking photos, and I even had
      someone coming over to check I wasn’t having a heart attack while I was kneeling in the wet grass
      getting close-up shots!
      </p>
      <p>
      The images I’ve chosen for this exhibition represent a chronological year of walking, from January
      to December. They aren’t obviously ‘photos of Glasgow”, as they are all close-ups - but they show
      the beauty and variety of nature that is always there around us, whether on a dull day or when the
      sun is shining.</p>`,

      intro: `
      <p>Becky runs Open Aye who provide provides engaging photography and videos for charity, social enterprise and community sector clients. They specialise in creating visual stories which show positive social change and aim to accurately reflect Scotland’s people, places, issues and solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
      They are a community interest company and create their own social impact, too. Open Aye also runs participatory photography projects, for a range of purposes, groups and topics. We run projects with advocacy outputs, therapeutic outcomes or social action research methodologies. 
      </p>
      <p>
      Since 2010 we have ran over 50 major participatory photo projects, engaging with 700+ participants from communities of difference, diversity, disability and disadvantage. Experts by experience need platforms to provide answers to many social issues. Open Aye helps with this, by providing inspiration, tools and a safe space for people to come together, consider creatively and suggest solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
      We're delighted to include some of Becky's photos as part of the exhibition as they capture the people who value and connect with, and in Glasgow's special places.</p>

      Hi my name is Michael M Sweeney, I’m a wildlife photographer from the East End of Glasgow. I am so grateful for the open spaces we have in our city. They allow me get out and about every day to explore these places of great wildlife diversity. 
      </p>
      <p>
      I’m in love with photography and the open spaces we have - such as my local Seven Lochs Wetland Park. It brings me a lot of self-healing and well-being – and I hope that by sharing my photos I can inspire other’s love for nature and the wildlife around them.</p>`,
