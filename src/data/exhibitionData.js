      intro: `
      <p>Emma is a recent sustainable development graduate living in the Southside of Glasgow with her two preschoolers. </p>
       
      <p>An amateur photographer primarily capturing and sharing the biodiversity that her local parks and woodlands possess. From the start of the initial lockdown, her family set out and continues to work towards their John Muir Award for conservation. This includes identifying species throughout Castlemilk park. </p>
       
      <p>When not volunteering, King's park is a favourite haunt for the family. Here is where the children have space to run, climb, play and picnic. Her photos aim to highlight the importance Glasgow's parks have on the wellbeing of local families and biodiversity.</p>
       
      <p>She chose these specific photos to highlight how green, healthy and wild Glasgow really is. They are all taken within Castlemilk and King's park, yet she stresses, the vast majority of Glasgow's green space holds similar qualities and should be nationally celebrated.</p>`,

      intro: `<p>We've followed Rider Glasgow on twitter over the last year.  We've loved the photos so were delighted to be allowed to include some in this exhibition.  Rider Glasgow's fantastic twitter profile provides "The (unofficial) view from a Glasgow Deliveroo rider's saddle" and it's this unique perspective which make his photos such a great snapshot of Glasgow. Everything from Friday night streets, to parks and green spaces and the hidden garden's and closes dropping off takeaways the photos really bring the beauty and the personality of Glasgow to life. </p>`,

His photos have been an inspiration since we started and he has been kind enough to allow us to use his photos on our website and now in this exhibition. Alisdair is a prolific photographer of the city and alongside sharing the personality and the humour of the city, many of his photos capture the spectacular natural beauty of sites like the Clyde, Glasgow Green and many of the City's parks and green spaces.

      intro: `<p>Walk to Work Glasgow (Liam Paterson)
      I started my Twitter feed as Walk to Work Glasgow in April 2019. I’m fortunate to be able to walk to
      work mostly along the River Kelvin and through the Botanic Gardens. It was spring and I was  
      gradually starting to take more notice of the season changing around me as I walked, and often
      stopping to take photos with my phone. I was using Twitter at work at the time, so I decided to start
      my own feed as a daily journal of the walk. The first images were the obvious stuff - sun on the
      river, tree shadows, pink rhododendrons bursting out - but I wanted to see a bit more detail. I
      bought a couple of clip-on macro lenses for the phone and then my focus expanded to tiny water
      droplets on feathers and petals, insects, ice and frost structures, spiders’ webs. I’m fascinated by
      combinations of colours, shapes and textures and the infinitely varied effects of light.
      Rather ironically, I’ve been working from home since last March rather than walking to work, but
      I’ve kept up my daily walks in the park. The fact that Glasgow still has a good network of public
      parks and open spaces will have been a great help to many during the course of the pandemic - it
      has been much busier along the Kelvin at times in recent months. This period of lockdown has
      emphasised how important it is for people in such a large city to have access to safe places to
      exercise, to slow down and stop, to just breathe. You can choose to be solitary in a park, or be in
      company - I’ve met a few people from my Twitter feed while taking photos, and I even had
      someone coming over to check I wasn’t having a heart attack while I was kneeling in the wet grass
      getting close-up shots!
      The images I’ve chosen for this exhibition represent a chronological year of walking, from January
      to December. They aren’t obviously ‘photos of Glasgow”, as they are all close-ups - but they show
      the beauty and variety of nature that is always there around us, whether on a dull day or when the
      sun is shining.</p>`,
